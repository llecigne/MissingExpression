TODO LIST
=========

GENERAL
-------
 * Unit tests

CSS-SELECTORS
-------------

 * Class selector does not support "" escaping syntax
     [foo=bar] => works
     [foo="bar"] or [foo="bar :+baz /"] => does not work

 * Optimize class selector matching (slow prototype implementation)

 * A test site allowing the user to play with its own site and selector
